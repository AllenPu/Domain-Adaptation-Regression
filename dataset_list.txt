You can replace src and tgt with:
visda: train and val in visda
a: amazon in office
w: webcam in office
d: dslr in office
A: Art in officehome
C: Clipart in officehome
P: Product in officehome
R: Real_World in officehome

We use ResNet-101 for vista and ResNet-50 for office and officehome.

You can also run: python -u train_version2.py --gpu_id n --src src --tgt tgt ,
which is anther version of BSP, which may achieve better performances in some datasets.
More interesting results may be found in the future about this phenomenon.
